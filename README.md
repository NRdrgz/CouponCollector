## Coupon Collector Problem

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Coupon Collector problem, a classic problem in probability theory. The problem explores how many trials (e.g., box openings) are needed on average to collect a complete set of unique items.

The Coupon Collector problem asks: Given a collection of `N` unique items, how many trials are needed to collect all items at least once? This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of this problem, including uniform and non-uniform distributions, and simulations using Monte Carlo methods.

## Simple Approach

In the simple scenario, each item has an equal chance of being collected in each trial. 

## Complex Approach

We also explore the problem from a different perspective: calculating the expected number of unique items collected after a given number of trials. 

## Non-Uniform Distribution

When the probabilities of collecting each item are not uniform (e.g., some items are rarer than others), the problem becomes more complex. We use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the number of trials needed to collect all items.
